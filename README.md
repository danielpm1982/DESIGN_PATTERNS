This Repository includes basic JAVA SE Console Projects with my implementation examples of the 23 GoF Design Patterns, based on the references: Head First Design Patterns (FREEMAN, Eric et al., 2004) and Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - The "Gang of Four" (GAMMA, Erich et al, 1994). It's basically Java SE code that can be used to design and implement model classes on web or mobile applications. JAVA8+ compatible.
