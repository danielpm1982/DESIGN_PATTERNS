These are my implementation examples of the 23 GoF Design Patterns, using JAVA SE 8, based on the references: Head First Design Patterns (FREEMAN, Eric et al., 2004) and Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software - The "Gang of Four" (GAMMA, Erich et al, 1994). It's basically Java SE code that can be used to design and implement model classes on web or mobile applications. These Design Patterns are also used on every Java Framework existent on the market, and are the basis for lots of other design patterns in all programming fields.
